-> All the Boolean Parameters if not configured is assumed to be false.
   If the parameter has to have the value "true", then that particular
   parameter must be explictly configured as true.

-> Communication Channel for all the Basic WakeupSources will be assumed as NULL_PTR.

-> The Parameter "osNumberOfCores" is not configured and it is assumed as one.


    
-> For the Wakeup Source "ECUM_WKSOURCE_POWER" EcuMComMChannel parameter
   is not configured. So, It is assumed as NULL_PTR.
-> For the Wakeup Source "ECUM_WKSOURCE_RESET" EcuMComMChannel parameter
   is not configured. So, It is assumed as NULL_PTR.
-> For the Wakeup Source "ECUM_WKSOURCE_INTERNAL_RESET" EcuMComMChannel parameter
   is not configured. So, It is assumed as NULL_PTR.
-> For the Wakeup Source "ECUM_WKSOURCE_INTERNAL_WDG" EcuMComMChannel parameter
   is not configured. So, It is assumed as NULL_PTR.
-> For the Wakeup Source "ECUM_WKSOURCE_EXTERNAL_WDG" EcuMComMChannel parameter
   is not configured. So, It is assumed as NULL_PTR.
    
-> For the Wakeup Source "ECUM_WKSOURCE_POWER" EcuMResetReasonRef parameter
   is not configured. So, It is assumed as "MCU_RESET_UNDEFINED".
-> For the Wakeup Source "ECUM_WKSOURCE_RESET" EcuMResetReasonRef parameter
   is not configured. So, It is assumed as "MCU_RESET_UNDEFINED".
-> For the Wakeup Source "ECUM_WKSOURCE_INTERNAL_RESET" EcuMResetReasonRef parameter
   is not configured. So, It is assumed as "MCU_RESET_UNDEFINED".
-> For the Wakeup Source "ECUM_WKSOURCE_INTERNAL_WDG" EcuMResetReasonRef parameter
   is not configured. So, It is assumed as "MCU_RESET_UNDEFINED".
-> For the Wakeup Source "ECUM_WKSOURCE_EXTERNAL_WDG" EcuMResetReasonRef parameter
   is not configured. So, It is assumed as "MCU_RESET_UNDEFINED".

-> EcuMValidationTimeout value for the Following wakeupsources are rounded off to the nearest integer as a count of
